DIY Arduino Macropad
Project Overview
This project is a DIY Macropad built using an Arduino board, designed to enhance productivity and workflow through customizable macros. The macropad allows users to assign keyboard shortcuts, application controls, or even complex sequences to physical keys, streamlining repetitive tasks in software like video editing, coding, or gaming.

Current Progress: 80% complete
Most of the core functionalities are in place, and the macropad is fully functional for basic macro operations. A few improvements, such as additional key configurations and user customization options, are still under development.
